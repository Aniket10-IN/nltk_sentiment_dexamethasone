Has caused severe swelling in my feet and ankles. can not wear shoes. It causes pain when standing or walking from intense pressure.
"66 year old male. 4 days dose of 40 mg / day for emergency raise platelet count for ITP.  My count went up to safe levels, but itÃ¢??s likely temporary, but it did it job.  Hiccups, cough, abdominal pain, hunger, mood swings, metallic taste in mouth, insomnia, gas, flatulent, diarrhea, trouble concentrating, and bloating. Good: it raised my blood count, gives lots of Ã¢??goodÃ¢?Â energy (not Ã¢??buzzyÃ¢?Â like caffeine but like you can run all day) and it IÃ¢??ve noticed my chronic pain has stopped.  Second day off med today, side effects slowly getting better.  Read More Read Less  "
took for dyshidrotic eczema.  within 24 hours swelling and hives noticeably lessened.  within 3 days  skin nearly  completely cleared. i have  tried steroid creams and countless other remedies.Nothing worked. this  worked. amazing  drug. minimal side effects 
I have only been on this medication since 11am yesterday.  Problem is I have now been wide awake since 3:30 am yesterday.  This really stinks since I have medical disabilities that make it difficult for me to sleep anyway.
"I had a platelet count of 23,000 and needed to get my counts up. I was perscribed this medication and have been on a 6 month treatment plan. Platelets are now in a safe range of 70,000 which is the highest that I have seen in the past two yrs, but they will not increase past 70k. I have a lot of swelling and weight gain. A lot of facial pain and tenderness. I lost some taste and appetite has increased tremendously. I get dizzy spells and very cranky on this medication as well. I feel bad for my fiance. I can feel myself getting mad over the littlest things. My doctor also is considering taking me off of it because my blood sugar levels are fairly high and we aren't getting the response from my platelets that we had hoped. Dissatisfied mainly because I was hoping for much better results with the treatment plan.Read More Read Less  "
"I'm 34 y/o female, had asthma attack that sent me to the hospital. Gave me dexamethasone shot, and sent home with 5 - 2 mg pills to take two days later. Still wheezing, but otherwise on the mend. It has seemed to help boost the effects of my other medications for asthma related issues. Has left me very thirsty so have been staying hydrated. Medication along with other steroid based medication for my asthma, all together has left me jittery for example, hands have had trembles. Otherwise no major issues. This is my first time on this particular medication.Read More Read Less  "
"I was diagnosed with lung cancer that spread to the brain. Iev been on dexamethosone 4gm x2 daily for 6  months. No problem, just weight gain"
"I took this medicine for dental inflammation after a dental implant became inflamed.  Took it yesterday last time as today I can barely function. Weak, fatigued, dizzy, numb all over, vision problems. I work a physical job and can barely perform it now. I feel like my face and hands are cold and unattached"
"I was prescribed this to help with a multiple sclerosis exacerbation. I was on a titrated dose for 10 days. I experienced blurry vision, headaches, swelling in my hands, legs, feet, face and abdomen, increased appetite, shortness of breath, and muscle pains. I am now 4 days post-treatment and I do not feel any better at all. I've used Prednisone in the past without any issues so I didn't forsee that the Dexamethasone would cause any big problems for me. I pray I NEVER have to use this medication again. Being only 4 days post-treatment, I understand it's still working in my system but I haven't noticed any improvement in the symptoms it was prescribed to treat.Read More Read Less  "
"Prescribed 4 mg tab/20 tablets by mouth 2x a day for five days to combat an MS flare.  Worked just like the IV Solumedrol for me.  Noticeable relieve of symptoms starting at day 2.  Lack of appetite and steroid taste metallic), which is the norm for me on any steroid were the only noticeable symptoms during treatment.  I did have irritated throat for two days after completing the dosage, but warm liquids and Aleve helped with that.  Much better than IV treatment! "
"I love this stuff!!  I have experienced no side effects and I can breathe again.  I am so grateful to have found this, as my asthma had been under control for years until I was exposed to forest fire smoke, and then none of my inhalors worked.  I am breathing again, and hope to be off the drug in 3 or so months."
"I was prescribed this due to pain/inflammation in a tooth I need a root canal on. I would rather deal with the tooth pain than the side effects I've had--and I've only taken for one day. I am irritable, bursting into tears for no reason one minute and laughing the next, I feel like my head is slightly detached from my body and have a bad headache (was having a headache before from the toothache but this is different) and spacey feeling, even though I don't really feel hot it does feel like the top layer of my skin is burning, I want to climb the walls, and I have had to warm my husband and children that I don't feel like I can control snapping at them for no reason, and probably won't be able to sleep tonight...AND my tooth still hurts so it didn't do what it was supposed to and gave me all these horrible other things to deal with. Not taking anymore, needless to say and will be calling my dentist in the morning to let them know.Read More Read Less  "
Used as a steroid and anti inflammatory drug during nose operation. My wife was manic & disorientated for a couple of days following surgery. Settled down after drug dissipated from body. 
"I took this for tendonitis inside my elbow.  It upset my stomach, gave me dry mouth, I slept poorly, and I felt confused.  Worst of all I felt out of breath and had a tightening in my chest while exercising or working.  I ended up taking a stress test to check my heart.  Days after taking I am starting to feel normal.  May have affected my sex drive."
"I was on a 20 mg/week dose for 2.5 years. Compared to other chemo treatments, this drug was a piece of cake.  After a 7 mo rest, I'm on a 20, a 4, and then a 4 mg dose for three consecutive days every week again. It relieves bone pain, boosts my spirits, and controls G.I. chemo issues before the dose wears off after a few days. I can live with a little sleep loss, but then there is a post-dose crash after a few days that I have to get through.    Listen if you have trouble with this wimpy drug, then you had better never contract cancer because those chemo drugs will certainly kill you or at least make you feel like you are dead.Read More Read Less  "
"I was prescribed this med after spinal fusion for nerve issues. This is the worst medicine I have ever taken.  Irritable, can't sleep, heartburn, anxiety, sensitive to smell and loss of taste.  I finished this med 5 days ago and I still have the side effects. And it never relieved any of the pain I was feeling.  I would never recommend this drug to anyone.  And it made me rate with stars.. I would not give this even 1."
"Took 10 days of a dose pak.  I am diabetic.  My a1c was never more than 7.4 before taking this drug.   After taking this med for 10 days, a1c went to 8.9.  14 weeks later, a1c is 8.5.  Looks like this med has made my diabetes 2 much worse permanently.  Very upsetting!"
"I was put on this medication 2 days ago for nerve pain from my neck, so far it is helping. Only side effect is sleeping. I have been taking melatonin pryer, so I'll try & up the dosage.I also have oral lichen planus this medication has helped, the  inflammation has receded, so maybe it will help with both problems. "
Simply awful drug. The side effects outweigh any good in it and I am still suffering from an infected mouth several weeks after stopping it. So grateful my swollen feet have improved.
Feeling weak & disoriented. Headache has lessoned quite a bit. Only on this for 5 days so far.
went to er for my complex migrains they gave me this steroid after the i was pretty much knocked out i woke up cant breath well right side of face swollen low grade fever cant see well and my sin burns like hell.
"This is a horrible drug. It causes facial swelling, it changed my personality,made me moody and hungry all the time.I was on it for months and now I am suffering from withdrawels. There has to be a better drug"
Good steriod
After Kemo Taking this drug once in morning &  once in evening helps relieve nausea. I havnt had any problems and the relief from naussea is a God send. I take within an hour of getting up in the morn & around dinner 5 -6pm. Highly recommend!!!
"I was given this drug for inflammation in my back.  I have hard ware in my back causing compression fractures.  Step-down medication.  I only took for 1 1/2 days (6 pills 2 mg) Allergic reaction. Puffy face, red blotchy rash/itching on face. Also made me irritable/agitated. Bad drug. Would not recommend this drug to reduce swelling in back. It appears to be the wrong drug for my issue. PA at urgent care clinic probably should have prescribed a short-order of prednisone which I can take.  I looked at other reviews.  Side effects/allergic reactions are pretty severe.  I would not recommend this drug.  Read More Read Less  "
"I was prescribed this medication and about a week after taking it I suffered from the following: low blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar. I had to take insolent shots, increase cholesterol medication, and told to take salt to increase my blood pressure.  "
"I learned yesterday, that my blood sugar reading has gone through the roof. I did not know that this was a side effect of the drug. Diabetes runs in my family and I have been fortunate not to have that monster to deal with on top of my multiple myeloma, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and kidney problems. The dex is also causing me to retain so much water. "
Caused heart to beat rapidly. Swelling of face ; sweating. Extreme tiredness. 
"I had a root canal and four days later was till having constant dull ache. My dentist put me on this for three days and the pain started going away the first day. No side effects at all, very happy with the results."
"After suffering over a month with strep-throat and a sinus infection I had immediate relief with this med. However, it raised my blood glucose amount and I had some painful foot swelling. On a positive note, it did reduce my hunger cravings. I actually lost weight!"
it helped me get thru the rough days now to get thru getting off of it
"Was given these with another short 4 days dose of erlone tabs and this medicine. I have eczema at the side of nose all the way on the cheeks to the laughing lines. After 2 days of medication plus my essential face oil on the 3rd day it'll be looking good. It's my 4th course of medication within 6mths and i hope it''ll be the last set! It'll causes weight gain and ""puffy cheeks"", but overall it helped relieve the swelling and cracking of my eczema !"
"The reason I took the drug is not in the list above, I took it for swelling related to dental implants. Severe Headache & very severe eye pain. I stopped using after 5 pills as the pain continued to get worse. Pain was gone after drug wore off. "
"It has controlled my MM very well. But the side effects are terrible. I have gained 50 lbs on it, became very irritable, mood swings, taste of food is horrible and at times have metallic taste in mouth, swelling in feet and ankles, ended up with catatracts after only 8 months, had surgery on both eyes, constant respiratory infections, confusion can't do simple things I do every day,extreme sweating even in an air conditioned room at 68 to 70 degrees the sweat is running down my face and my co workers are freezing. Have had just about every side effect possible with this, but it controls my MM and I can't take anything else. They had given me Rev and Thal and had such bad reactions I had to be taken off of them. So as long as I can tolerate this I will stay on it. Have been on Decadron/Dexamethasone for since Dec. 2007.Read More Read Less  "
has this medication made anyone exremmly angry?
"high dose, tapered over 4 days resulting in psychosis with suicidality"
"I am waiting to see a neurosurgeon as I have swelling in my brain and was prescribed this drug - I have had horrible side effects - bloating, dizziness, aggressiveness, insomnia, puffy face, swollen eyelids - horrible, horrible, horrible drug. I am hoping to take something else to reduce the swelling, but the side effects are horrible. I feel completely out of sorts and even if it's working, the physical agony doesn't even seem worth it. Add to that, it causes ulcers so I am taking a prescription pepcid pill which is causing severe constipation. I have never felt so horrible in my life - not even when I had surgery for breast cancer. There has to be a better way.Read More Read Less  "
I was given 2 1/2 tablet at ER as a one time dose for severe swallowing problems due to a thoat infection with ear and lymph gland association.  withi9n 8 hours my pain was greatly improved.
"What fun it is taking a drug like this,the side effects for me start with eye pain,head-  aches,eating all the time,weigh gain,up every  hour to wee-wee,dizzy all the time,and many more.But in all fairness I have to say  it works for me. I was tired of going to chemo 5 days a week for years.I take 10 4mg  pills a day for 4 days then off for 5 days   and start over .But I'am still living the good life."
"My doctor prescribed me this medication for an inflamed eustachian tube. I have never experienced this before and it has been annoying and painful (hard to swallow, eat, drink, yawn, etc.). I am only prescribed to take one in the morning for three days along with a nasal spray. I took my first one this morning and it is 7 p.m. and the pain is gone. I just feel some heartburn, but I'd rather have some heartburn than deal with the pain of the inflammation. It has worked great so far."
Decreased platelets due to leukemia. Bruising and bleeding under the skin. Been on for 4 days. A little less bleeding and bruises fading. A little jittery and not sleeping real well but arthritis in feet much improved      
"Prescribed for headaches and nausea from radiation on the brain. It has relieved both of those, however I crave food all the time and the meds give me heartburn which is not a good combo.  Also having issues with bowels and unable to really sleep even when taking sleep meds.  The relief it gives outweighs the side effects without a doubt."
"I have been experiencing muscle spasms,aching, radiating nerve pain in my left shoulder, leftside of next and arm.  It's a good possibilty that I have a ruptured disc in my neck that is irritating the nerve and cuasing the pain in my shoulder blade and arm.  for the past few days I have been having really really bad muscle spasms in my neck and shoulder and the side effect of that has been sending a shooting pain down my arm and hand on the left side.  After taking this medication for one full day out of a five day prescription, the muscle spasm are almost completely gone and the overall cramping in my shoulder is now bearable.  Obviously it will not fix the possibility that I might have a ruptured disc in my neck, but it has now made it manageable until I can have my MRI and decide if I need surgery to rectify the problem.  I have done physical therapy and tried other pain killers and anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxer and none have given me the relief that this medication has given me.  It does make me nauseous, slightly jittery, and some times a little dizzy....but that is much easier to deal with than the pain I was having.  The benefits have definitely out weighed the risk in my situation. Read More Read Less  "
"I've been taking this medication for the past eight months due to breast cancer and spinal issues due to the cancer spreading into my bones and blood. I started with 16mg and now have been happy to say I am now on .5 mg this medication has the worst side effects I've ever noticed. I take lots of meds due to my health and the side effects of this medication  is unbearable. It truly helps with pain and allows me to do things maybe I wasn't unable to do but the WEIGHT GAIN and UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO EAT is crazy. Chocolate, sweets anything you just can't stop eating. I've gained 50 pounds, I use to weigh  110lbs and now I weigh 160pds.and I don't even know how to carry it. It's hard to get dress, pick things up off the floor and its all in the mid-section and my face is like a balloon. I look as though I'm having a child. If it wasn't for the weight gain and the urge to always eat constantly this med would be fine. I can't wait to be completely off. There has to be something better out there, or a way to stop the urge to constantly EAT EAT EAT !!!!!!!!!!!Read More Read Less  "
"Took for pain in shoulder from small tendon tear and mild arthritis. now have more pain then to begin with,( all over),cant sleep, and pounding heart when I laid down. Only took 2 pills in 4 days, not gonig to finish it."
"wow have taken 5 days of this medicine starting with 4 for 3 days and then 3 for 3 days and im quitting it, i havent slept and im a nervous wreck and a zombie. I quit it 2 days ago and im still feeling it, it is still in my system. even when i lie down and close my eyes i dont sleep, i can still hear every little dust particle..this is crazy....never again"
very good for childhood asthma
"I was given 2 1/2 of these pills in the E.R. due to a swollen and sour neck and throat from an unknown infection to my tonsils.  The following day I noticed a huge decrease in the pain, swelling and tenderness.  Seems to have worked great for me.  It was given one time, and one time only.  I really had no side effects at all. Works great! A+!!"
"Well, I usually dont come back and leave a review on anything unless it just STINKS but on rare occasion I am so pleased with something i HAVE to share.  I have MS(Dx 7/2005 at 34). I have taken this oral 4mg pikk 3x daily to fight MS flare ups.  This flare up was especially bad leaving me unable to even care for myself at the most basic levels.  Doc phoned in this med. Started my 3x daily at noon yesterday and took on ein the evening before bed.  I am SO pleased that I woke up this morning with marked improvement in ability to walk, and stand. I actually could take a shower and I just got back from Wawa to get FRESH milk for my morning coffee when i have not been ablt to drive there, navigate the store and line and register and drive home safely in WEEKS!  I know this isnt a miracle pill and Im far from back to my old baseline of ability but just the fact I regained my ability for the simplest tasks really made me grateful that these little tic-tacs are helping me.  I remain hopeful to see where they get me over the next 72 hours of treatments.  I know steroids are like treating poison with poison but when you so sivck you feel like you're dying anyhow it's so worth the gamble.Read More Read Less  "
shattered toothe do to a fall in the middle of the night.  Only taken four doses so far and the relief is great.  having toothe extracted by oral surgeon tomorrow.  nervous as hell and can't sleep from anxiety...but sure the relief will be....can't wait for the pain to stop!!!!
"Had a fall and fractured back top tooth, severe pain...Just started this medication this morning and the relief is amazing.!"
"Currently taking this to reduce swelling from a shattered tooth that I will be having surgery on. This is a tough med to take as it causes severe mood swings, irritability (you will become a raving b itch) and hunger. And the hunger especially sucks when you can't eat due to the teeth pain. But, I will say this - it does reduce the swelling. If your doctor insists, then take it, but if you have time and can let swelling subside slower and on its own than I'd recommend to do so. Unfortunately for me, I need it to turn around fast as I need the surgery. Good luck and happy eating! And don't kill your husband!! ;) Read More Read Less  "
"I was given this medication to get rid of a rash on my legs. I have felt very weird. I don't feel like mt self at all. My head hurts want to sleep all the time, but can't. Feel jittery and wired, not relaxed, and I am feeling some anxiety."
"This was prescribed to reduce some swelling in my throat as I was recovering from chemo/radiation treatment for cancer of the larynx.  It worked well in that respect and was easy to use, however, the side effects were tough to deal with.  After 11 days, taking 4 times a day, my feet and ankles were enormous and muscle weakness in my legs.  I could barely walk, couldn't step up onto a curb or climb steps, get up from a sitting position without GREAT effort or help. The incision from where my feeding tube was removed wasn't healing either - all side effects from this med.  Dr. decreased dosage amt. slowly and I was feeling much better within a month.  Listen to your body and report what it is telling you to your doctor ASAP.  Pay attention to the side effects listed. Read More Read Less  "
It has helped the platelet problem ITP but Iam left with a swollen face ankles and a rash here and there. Now that I have stopped therapy I am shakey and tired. 
"I had a small infection on my lower leg around the ankel. The drug kept me awake for days made me very nervous and of corse very tired . Then became very irritable and then depressed and still very irritable. An over all bad experence. I only took the drug for 4 days. then stopped it,and now 6 days later still not doing well."
"prescribed to me after dental surgery w/ periodontist....took 6 tabs of 0.75 mg today, day of surgery, will take 3 tabs tomorrow and 2 tabs the following day, then no more...My thinking seems clear, very high / low mood swings, hunger is there and absolutely no pain anywhere today, not even the usual joint pain from arthritis.  Note I did take other drugs, including Darvocet for pain but I had the other side of my mouth done 6 months ago and I KNOW the pain will set back in after I taper from this med.  I sure appreciate it's effect except for the rampant mood swings. Read More Read Less  "
I used this drug due to an infection in my jaw --- the point was to reduce inflammation. I am a type 1 diabetic on an insulin pump and I had to stop taking it after my first dose because I can not keep my blood sugar any lower than 495. I have taken almost 3 days worth of insulin in one day with unsuccessful control. I would not recommend to other diabetics.
i have experienced the puffy face and i am hungry all of the time. i can't get enough food.
Taking it for Lichen Planus of the tongue.  Two years of preventing more severe outbreaks.  The ulcers  and lesions remain present.
"Have been using this for 1 week for lower back pain.  Works well but the side effects are bad. Sleeplessness, hunger, thirst, constant urination but blood sugar has spiked severly.  Have diabetes type 2 and sugar levels are triple where they should be."
"I am currently taking a 6 day pack for an allergy to poison ivy. I am on day 3 and have had bad side effects. I feel like I have a very very hard heart beat. The 2nd day I was so dizzy I fell, constant heart burn. Today has been confusing, and I have presented anxiety. In the evening I have been experiencing dryness. It feels as though my whole body is dry, dehydrated. On a good note, the poison ivy allergy is slowly clearing up and I dont have the ""insane itch"". "
"I'm on a short-term low dose as my RE tries to find out why I either don't conceive or I conceive then miscarry.  I've had the hunger, bloating, peeing, thirst, and sleep problems (but I already had sleep problems so may not be the med).  But nothing I can't live with, and definitely not the worst side-effects I've ever had.  Have had way worse side-effects from some antibiotics, Lunesta, glucophage, Rozerem.  The lower dose may be part of that.  Have no idea if the med is effective or not, but it's not been too bad for me.Read More Read Less  "
"I was given this for inflammation in my gums that caused severe sensitivity in my teeth. It worked very well for reducing the inflammation, but the side effects were dreadful. I had been put on Prednisone earlier in the year, and had bad side effects from that but these toppped that. I had constant cravings and hunger; I gained 20 pounds because of it. I had weird dreams, and woke up constantly from terrible night sweats. I would soak the bed and pillows. I was extremely irritable and shakey. I was extremely hyper and anxious. My urine became very cloudy and I had horrible water retention/bloating. I had horrible nausea, dizziness, and heartburn. I had terrible headaches and an irregular monthly cycle. It interfered with my birth control pills. I also wound up in the emergency room due to a rare side effect in which I had severe pain in my legs to the point that I couldn't walk. I then had to be put on a prescription pain reliever that is normally given to people after surgeries. The experience of being on this drug were worse than my pregnancy and ceasarean section combined! It did its job, but the side effects were not worth it. I would try to find another drug.

The directions given by my dentist were to rinse with the Dexamethasone twice a day...hold in my mouth as long as I could stand and then spit out. It really helped.

"My dentist prescribed .75mg tablets 3/day to relieve swelling around a tooth. After a couple days, the pain in my shoulders due to arthritis was also greatly lessened. I experienced no unusual side affects."
I am using this medicine after having fusion back surgery.  He said it is to help keep my swelling down.  The side effects are harsh though.  I have to eat or I get very gittery and I eat ALOT.  I can't sleep at night because I wake up sweating so bad and I am breaking out.  I am also experiencing bruising and cutting my skin very easily.

"I am undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.  I'm taking Taxol and this drug is used in pill form of 5 tablets of 4 mg each the pm then am before the Taxol chemotherapy treaatment.

My first treatment I had severe reactions immediately to Taxol and was given additional Dex and Benadryl and it worked.

"Unlike most other posts here, I've had very few problems with side effects. I'm on a wide range of chemo and OTC drugs, with Dex being just one. My indigestion is controlled with a prescription heartburn med., and I've noticed no taste decrease or increase of appetite (maybe because of the chemo?). The dex has been VERY effective in treating my myeloma, and my back pain is nearly gone. "
"Taken for: Optic Neuritis.  By the time I was given this medication, I had lost all vision in my left eye.  Within 3 days, I gained most it back (20,30).      My doctor kept me on this med for 2 months because the swelling/pain in my legs/knees from Fibromyalgia/Osteoarthritis was greatly reduced.   My energy level jumped through the roof.  I could get up in the morning (no stiffness) and had the energy to shower, cook breakfast, go shopping.  I hadn't been able to do that for 3 years (even with meds like lyrica).  He took me off of this drug and my energy dropped and pain slowly returned.  I miss this medication even though the side effects are a bit overwhelming.  I had massive cravings for food, but I was on the atkins diet so I did not gain any weight (but no loss either).  Also, I became very irritable.. almost like I lost my inner censorship voice.  I would just say whatever came to mind with no forethought for how it might affect the person listening.

"I was given this medicine after surgery.  It made me feel depressed.  I also experienced the following symptons, hiccups,stomach acid, trouble sleeping and weight gain and problems with my esphogus. oh yeah, I also developed sores."
my 2yr old son was given the medication because of a constant dry cough. the dr said it sounded like an 'asthma cough'...it worked very well. the pharmacists that filled the prescription did not give any paperwork on side effects or anything...he has had an increase of appetite and pretty moody...but he has also just turned TWO years old!.... 
"My doctor rx'd this for treatment of plantar fascitis. It has worked well, but my appetite increased greatly and my mood became more irritable. I have noticed some edema in my ankles on the 3rd day after tapering down and stopping the medication. But in fairness I had to fly home for a funeral, so this probably contributed. Overall I am pleased with this treatment. It beats having steroid injections into my foot!"
"untreated lung/brain cancer. used to address symptoms and is prolonging and making my life bearable. the side effect are terrible but I'll trade them any day for the vision loss, dementia, unbearable headaches with eye pain. I'm into pallitive radiation now and hope to wean off in couple weeks.  if not then I'll keep doing whatever it takes to get to the end with the best quality time with family and friends.  there is no cure and opted not to have chemo.  "
Medication has help reduce pain and swelling of joints due to arthritis.
"Side effect of sleep deprivation is torture.  I'm dizzy, confused, and trying to fight off the weight gain. This is the strongest & strangest medicine I've ever taken. Talk to your Doc thoroughly before trying."
" i had spinal cord compression, and they put me on it. i hate it. my face is swollen, i feel like a water ballon. it is harder to walk. i am irritable beyond belief, confused, anxiety, can't sleep, food is nasty, caused heartburn. The more they increased the worse i felt. Now they ""weaning"" me cause you can't just STOP."
"it made me fat, then it made my eyes feel like i was always looking thru a fire,then it made my knees feel like they were blowing up from the inside out.over all id rather have just dealt with the pain, now i need to loose 35 pounds as well as get better from my surgery, nice combo"
"This medication was prescribed for an allergic skin reaction.  While the medication cleared the reaction, it was extremely difficult to tolerate.  Excessive thirst, very frequent urination, profuse sweating or ""hot flashes"", and sleeplessness were just a few of my side effects.  I was finally able to stop taking after 5 days of a 14-day prescription since the rash went away.  Even thought I have gone off the medication, I'm still feeling very sluggish."
"This medication what prescribed to me for Poison Ivy. This medication is extremely potent and has a variety of side effects. I will not recommend this drug to anyone. I am having trouble concentrating, nauseous, constantly hungry. I have no taste buds and I am retaining fluid and constantly having to go to the bathroom. This is a harsh drug that should not be prescribed lightly."
My daughter was given this med because of swollen adnoids and after the first day of use her snoring has completely stopped.  She did not really like the taste though.
"Used for a reaccurring sinus infection, itched incessantly, felt bloated, fat, irritable, etc. "
"After I had lumbar back surgery I had pain in my legs 100 times worse than before the surgery. I figured it was somewhat normal considering the surgery and timing of the pain. The pain came on when the medicine gradually ran out of a small ball like ?pump thingy that put anesthetic stuff on my surgery site few days after surgery. I was put on the steroid by my surgeon for 10 days, taper down after 4mg. 3times a day for 3 days. It DID take 95% of the worst pain in  my legs due to the inflammation of surgery, BUT I HATE this drug! it completely messed up my ability to taste, constant hunger, very sore tongue,irritable, I just feel there could have been some other drug used to adequately treat the inflammation/pain WITHOUT the EXTREMELY terrible side effects. This has been the worst (for side effects) drug I have EVER taken!!!Read More Read Less  "

"I had severe covid. My throat swelled almost shut, my chest was so incredibly congested and coughing hurt. Doctor prescribe prednisolone and within hours, my throat swelling and pain were gone and my chest congestion decreased dramatically. 2 days later, I felt basically back to normal even though I still had active covid. These steroids are a great for people with severe covid symptoms"
I was in the hospital for a week with severe bi lateral covid pnemonia and was given Dexmethasone by IV..It definitely helped save my life.
Thanks for educating me about this dexamethasone drug
"I was diagnosed positive for the Covid-19 virus on January 8, 2022 and spent 3 days in the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado. I also have Myasthenia Gravis disease and was having breathing problems. I was given  3 separate infusions of Remdesivir and put on 6 mg of dexamethasone for one week. I spent the first night on Oxygen but did not require it the next day. I have regained pretty much normal breathing and feel much better now. I am back on 20 mg of Prednisone now for my Myasthenia Gravis disease after the Dexamethasone. My wife also got the virus as well but didn&#39;t need to be hospitalized but was given Oxygen for a week along with Dexamethasone as well. Neither of us had any kind of elevated temperatures before or during treatments."
I got tested positive for covid so I&#39;m taking Dexamethasone but in pills so wish me luck 😅
"Hi I&#39;m un-vaccinated  and I&#39;m getting super crazy regular headache after I got covid and recovered,  what can I use for the headache?"
I just got put on dexamethasone for chronic lung disease and my oxygen levels were running in the low to mid 80’s and now I’m in my 3rd week of taking it and just started my taper and my oxygen levels are running in the low 90’s without using my oxygen tank so I pray I’m getting better I’ve been dealing with this for a year now so please pray
A best friend of mine had covid that turned into pneumonia. Dexamethasone saved his life he told me.
Thanks for the good news Dr. Hansen !
It would be nice to see an updated video from you on this medication since it’s been over a year since this one was published.
"Benefited from the knowledge acquired. I’m 49, Got COVID pneumonia on October 2021, treatment is Dexamethasone and Prednisolone. Recovering is on its way."
"My parents got covid.. my father progressed from moderate to severe covid very quickly at home.. our doctor prescribed dexamethasone together with other meds on his 12th day of covid..maybe just in time before the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; could totally wreck havoc.. aftr just 1 day he felt alot better.. blood pressure returned to normal, oxygen level rose.. fever gone.. thank u Lord fr this breakthrough."
Dexamethasone is an insidious drug that has horrible and sometimes permanent side effects. No way.
I had the chinavirus last year for 3 weeks because I figured I just had a cold like I do once every 5 years. I went to get this steroid and I was good in 3 days.
Philippines FDA vs Dr. Fabunan
"So we&#39;re prescribing a WHO-recommended immunosuppressant that propagates bacterial infections, to people with bacterial infections in their lungs, and telling them to get vaccinated when dexamethasone says to not be vaccinated while prescribed, all because it&#39;s loosely associated with 1/3rd less deaths for people being killed by the WHO-recommended ventilator treatment.<br><br>lol ok"
"Do you feel azythromycin works? I have Covid and my doctor is prescribing me hydroxychloroquine, azyhtro, and methypredisnolone , i feel this is too overkill on medication."

Dose of copper.. one pound of liver...  super  dose... all sickness  gone...

"I underwent chemotherapy between August-December, 2018 for ovarian cancer and I was given Dexamethasone. How long does it last in your body, please? I&#39;m doing the Covid-19 swabs and I keep on testing NEGATIVE for Covid. Also, I&#39;m still clear off cancer :)"
Researchers like Mike Hansen can give us information to make informed decisions.
Thanks bro

Dexamethasone is safe in hypertension
Dexamethasone was part of Covid 19 medications given to me at later stages of treatment.
"OK DEXAMETHISONE IS GOOD FOR YOU, But don&#39;t come back to doctors or E/R For they will turn you away and think you have a other problems and think your crazy .  the beginning of the pain and suffering does not appear on test for a long enough time when its to late and nothing they can do except dose you with more hormones treating you like addisons D&#39;S For the rest of your hellish suffering in agony life."
Does DEX help lower the igm and igg?
"Doctor prescribed dexamethasone for Covid, it helped me with Covid symptoms but now that I stopped taking it&#39;s the problem, it affected me so much that I lost strenght in my body can&#39;t even walk anymore. I would not recommend taking this steroid it&#39;s so bad"
"My dad got dexamethasone for 7 days, 2 dose 4ml for 3 days, 1 dose for 3 days and 0.5 dose for 2 days, and then Etason for 10 days, he is now very good. <br>Dexamethasone is breakthrough"

Dexamethisone &#39;. agony suffering suicide is what this drug can and will cause.
"Thank You Dr Hansen for doing all these videos, I have more of an  understanding  about Covid-19 from your videos, I use to be an EMT and I get what your saying,  I am retired now with SLE Lupus, Osteoarthritis, and  Secondary Adrenal Insufficiently so I have to take hydrocortisone tabs and I take a sub q injection of 1ml of methotrexate every week, my immune system is already shot"
"My dad has tested positive for COVID 19 2 weeks ago. He had fever for 7 days with blood reports CRP 2.47 mg/dl , ddimer 516ng/ml. The Pulmologist has started with low dose 16mg per day of methylprednisolone and formonide 0.5 mg nebulization. He is recovering will have to see"
Dose of dexamethasone tablet...?
"dexamethasone is even stronger than prednisone, and a blister pack of prednisone will knock out just about anything."

Could you please send me the link to buy the NEW* Respokare® N95 Respirator Mask
I had 1 injection of Dexamethisone 5 years ago and still recovering from Adrenal insufficency plus steroid phsyichosis Immune lowered to Dangerous levels . Embarrassment and suicidal thoughts. Many also died from suicide do to Steroid induced Depression. Immune at levels to catch any thing. Funny it works with lowering immune and cause adrenal shut down or insuffiency in many.

Good news? Hooray! Spread the good news.
Dexamethasone study of end stage steroid use is murder. the control group had no steroid instead of drug of choice Methylprednisolone. they called it usual care instead of no steroid.
Thank you again Dr. Mike . Now I understand why I see decardon given to our patients with moderate to severe cases lately .
This video has been one of your best. Excellent presentation doctor!! 👏🏼😊❤️🙏🏼
"If this is really good, spread the word."
I wonder how they would feel about this drug when Trump endorses it?
We gotta pray to God for all people.
Dexamethason cause of death in covid
"I got pneumonia from covid19. Started taking prednisone two days ago and the next day (yesterday) I start having shortness of breath. I stop taking it. Started taking Zinc. The following day, I felt a little better. Called my doctor to let her know and she asked me to go to the ER as she could hear my shortness of breath. The doctor at the ER changed prednisone to prednisolone. I&#39;m scared to take 6 tablets at once (his prescription) and get worse again. My oxygen level is pretty good: 99. From your video, I have the impression I shouldn&#39;t be taking this stuff bc it&#39;s not a severe case, and surprising my immune response could worsening my situation as it did with the prednisone. I&#39;m scared as you said I can be okay one hour and then get worse pretty quickly."
Lets hope the good news is well spread.
Dexamethisone a cancer treatment drug . i and many friends took it and wished to GOD they did not. it can kill or couse agony horror phsychosis ostioperosis cushings like syndrome ostio ROID RAGE AND MORE. SUICIDE . NO BOLONEY. MANY FRIENDS. 1 INJECTION ALL IT TAKES FOR MANY.

What would be the immediate side effects of dexamethasone ?
It&#39;s gotta be safe.
Have the good news been spread already? Let&#39;s not forget the vaccines.
Have the news already been spread? Still waiting to get back to work. Let&#39;s not forget the vaccines.
Dear doctor if someone&#39;s developing hypoxia then what&#39;s d dose of dexona and for how many days.
"Great video Doc. My mother in law on dexamethasone for her cancer. So I hope there is a protection of some sort. Even tho we don&#39;t know for sure.. Love your videos, keep them coming."
Lets hope the good news is spread all across the country. I want a good happy ending.
"We want over-the-counter drugs for Covid.  If we have to go to a doctor, we might as well get a prescription for Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin &amp; Zinc.  HCQ has been used for 65 years."
"Why can’t we actual use this, and I haven’t heard anyone else talking about it."
Dr. Mike you are so knowledgeable. I love watching your videos. So informative and independent. You don’t make it political like some other 👍
HYDROCLOQUIN!!!!. It works!!!🌹🌹🌹🌹
"I just came off it. I was in the hospital 5 days with COVID and was given 6mg via IV and sent home with a 6 day regime of 6mg per day. It opened my lungs THANK YOU LORD JESUS! I think it makes me dizzy,  lightheaded, insomnia and a lil indigestion but that&#39;s ok, I can breathe! I only feel swollen in the face and hands too.

She&#39;s now doing better somewhat according to my Son who a report on her daily, seems my Son has no symtoms so they told him not to get tested I don&#39;t agree , and when she comes home shouldn&#39;t there be some precautions? Your videos are so helpful can&#39;t thank you you enough, praying daily for everyone  who like you are Heros ! Through this , the news &amp; even our own government won&#39;t give us straight answers . God Bless"
"I would like everyone to know about this vital information and  to reach everyone as possible as i can reach.  My aunt, age 54, who had earlier announced to us that she tested positive, with mild symptoms and in self isolation at home, just called to inform us that she had become negative of the corona-virus.<br> <br>She disclosed what she did while in isolation in order to become negative after earlier testing positive. She said she put in more effort to boost her immunity in isolation by regularly exercising on a treadmill. In boosting her immunity, she said she got in contact with Dr Kpomosa on Facebook who suggested she consumed Vitamin C, Carrots and black-seed oil and also mixed his herbal extract prepared with honey. She also disclosed to us that the , Pharmacologist and a Traditional herbal doctor(Dr Kpomosa) said &quot;look, I am going to send to you this herbal formula to be taken with black seed oil mixed with pure honey and turmeric , it boosts immunity&quot;. She said she did as he directed, and few days later, she tested negative.<br> <br>We are all very excited and happy for her. She said there might be very potent local solutions to boost overall immunity against COVID-19, but it depends on the willingness and courage of not narrowing down the treatment options open to us like that of Madagascar , and that alternative ( Herbal treatment) regimen can also be a life safer if people are well informed about them. As i share this with you, myself and my family are using same strategy to overcome this unfortunate situation. You can reach out to the Herbal Doctor for other health situation that seems impossible to cure, believe me there is a cure to every illness. for help/advice you reach Dr.kpomosa on Facebook Page &quot;Dr. Kpomosa home of relief&quot;. Get more information on how you can boost your immune system to be very strong against all kind of virus and illness."
So a point he seems to be making is should we give the steroid to rapidly progressing patients
Thank you!!!
"I’m a long haul COVID patient, 5 months into recovery from the associated pneumonia. Of all the various treatments I’ve tried prednisone is the only thing that works to keep my symptoms under control. Started on 50 mg/daily 3 weeks ago and been experimenting to find the lowest possible maintenance dose to keep shortness of breath, cough, brain fog, and fatigue under control. I tried tapering down in 10 mg increments. At this stage of my illness I find that 40 mg/day is the right dose for me. Anything less than 30 mg/day and my symptoms return, accompanied by unpleasant steroid withdrawal. My body tolerated the prednisone very well, no side effects noted. I am taking calcium, vitamin b6 and vitamin D supplements while on steroid therapy. I cannot day enough good things about prednisone for this Covid long hauler! It’s been a real game changer !!"
real doctors teach how to enrich the body with natural remedies and not pharmaceutical drugs
FAI Philippines pls study about it. Just a little research about it .thnks..and  comment pls.
We stopped using Dex. I can&#39;t find much on PubMed. Anyone?
"Dexamethasone is a type steroid, and it has been used in 2003 against SARS. A few years later, patients treated by Dexamethasone showed severe health issues with their lungs and bones."
That’s good news. I wouldn’t be the least surprised if many of the existing drugs today could also prove to be very effective.
Dr Richard Bartlett from Midland is giving Budesonide with an antibiotic and giving the zinc and hasn&#39;t lost a patient yet. Budesonide is an old drug that has been given to people with asthma for 30 years! Very few side effects and it works!!! But you have to use it with inhaler.  Why don&#39;t Drs jump on this! Because they didn&#39;t think of it?
Temps next week 111 ! It&#39;s apocalypse XXX ! 911 what&#39;s your emergency ??
It seems like this Covid is like some type of autoimmune disease I recognized some of the Meds because I do have Crohns disease and my Gastro Doc mentioned once that people who do smoke cigarettes has less Crohns flares but naturally no Doc will consider that and  also noticed that some people who were smokers that had Covid it did not affect them as bad and had a better outcome then those who did not smoke just wanted to share that and thank you for this great info Doc
Dr. Mike Haven’t heard from you in quite a while. Wishing you Well!!!
Would like you to discuss tocilizumab. Thanks!
Dallas doctor is talking about Budesonide w/ a nebulizer.  He&#39;s had 100% success rate.  Said...earlier the better.
You can give dexametasona /6 h to treat cerebral edema. Ej 4 mg/6h.  If you are going to treat other inflamatory conditions with a lower dosis you can give it /24 h
In the Philippines the Health Dept does not recognize it. To them it is DEXAMEPOISON
Dr what is your opinion on Coronil?
We should all help each other in Covid 19. We should donate to mask companiees. One of my favorites is UV mask. You should donate to them at :@t
"Thanks. For me, Dexamethasone and Ibutamoren was the winning combo."
Dexamethazone was rejected by Philippine DOH government since 35 yrs ago. Welcomed by Indonesian health minister and now under urgent process.
Have you thought about using nystatin? Maybe this is fungal related and not bacterial? Zinc and vitamin D have had some success because they have a antifungal component .
"Only dexamethasone  what if you add procaine, Booooooooooooooooom that&#39;s FAI that cure many different kind of diseases including covid19 in the province of Zambales Philippines...can cure covid19, hiv/aids,snake bite many more documented in Zambales Philippines."
"FAI/FIB antiviral/vaccine developed 35 yrs ago proven safe and very effective like venom of snake , a miracle drug  compose of dexamethasone and procaine, invented by Filipino scientist Doctor now in Indonesia waiting to finish documentation for the whole world."
I can&#39;t believe they are just finding this out now.  DUH!!!  This should have been tried when the virus was just starting.
Hi Dr. Mike Where can i find the results you&#39;ve talked about for RECOVERY trial?
Can I give dexamethasone and rimadryl to my dog at the same time?
"Hopefully we see good results. We’ve been using it in Houston and sadly it didn’t help my patient I worked closely with last week. 6 days she got dex, plasma, remdesivir, azithromycin, Rocephin. Day 6 cytokine storm and flash edema. Right before that I had percussed her from side to side and was really excited her SpO2 hit 100%. I thought we were gonna pull through. It’s disheartening."
I had this idea a couple of months ago. I was discussing this with my family.
The FAI Fabunan Antiviral Injection will end this Pandemic... pls support FAI..
Steroids are a magic bullet
"lol, Doctors seem to speak a different languague hahha :))) &lt;3"
FAI fabunan antiviral injection is the answer for covid 19 a cure is already found
I like to see a video on famotidine and how it might help Covid 19 symptoms.
Thanks Doc 4 this valuable information.
"I was wondering if other type of glucocorticoids can decrease or minimize the inflamatory tissue dammage.<br>That was a question I wrote in another video of you, Dr.<br>You know, there are many patients who take ramdomly so many type of drugs for previous illness, those drugs must be interfering in the Covid19 life cycle."
Hot!
"Dexamethasone was prescribed for me in my fight against multiple myeloma. Along with Revlimid and Velcade. Decades before,  dexamethasone was the only drug used in treatment of multiple myeloma."
Your videos are excellent.
dexamethasone for covid 19 <br><br>clinical trail results from the UK showed dexamethasone reduce mortality<br>in severely ill patients <br><br>-reduce mortality by about one third in ventilated patient <br><br>-reduce mortality by about one fifth in  patients requiring only oxygen
"GREAT video! Gives hope &lt;3 <br>We live in Sweden, I got infected 17 days ago and also have asthma. Question though: How do I know I have cytokine storms? I feel in general much much better but lungs its not 100% capacity yet I feel it and cant yet go out doing daily choirs or go to work. After day 5-11 had trouble deep breathing but my CRP was only 2 , no pneumonia. Still not 100% ok with lungs, but takes my Seretide Forte plus Bricanyl inhaler for my asthma. They are antiinflammatory if I got it right and I must takes them, without them during this I would end up in hospital. My instincts tell me might be mucus still stuck created by my white bloodcells and dead virus that still needs clear plus sore lungs still inflamed by Covid 19. I can deep breath now but feels it not ok yet. Maybe takes time heal?<br>Just worried if it supress immune too much with asthma medicine but according to this seems like I am  lucky having my asthma medicine during Covid 19 ( have hiv with normal immuns really good actually and now on zero lvl not contagious thanks to super early treatment from start allways will be like that they said ) helps with antiinflammatory respons in lungs, its a fine balance. Idk why France talked about not to take antiinflammatory like Ibubrufen, ( ok thats another type of antiinflammatory but idk )I mean seems like its better during Covid to calm down immune system not to risk cytokine storms?"
"Hello doctor , as earlier explained by you that this disease generates a severe cytokinin storm then tes logically dexamethasone and other class 1 anti histamines should have been administered . <br>Your videos have been helpful from the initial phases of this disease to know the severity , mode of action and prevelance of this disease . <br><br>Good job ."
"Hardly news. China used it back in 2003 during the Sars epidemic. While it saved a lot of lives, many patients were left with terrible life-long side effects like bad bones. Must be really careful with the dosis and only used as a last ditch resort."
It doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;approved&quot; for use in the United States. Many Doctors are using already. What is this apathy in the medical community?? 😯
"Dr. Mike, why did the medical community wait so long to give corticosteroids to extremely ill patients with breathing difficulties?! My 93 yr old grandmother was in a Nursing Home and all they gave her was Tylenol suppositories for fever and then oxygen, I guess her oxygen must have been low. She passed away, and I think she was undertreated. This was in New York and I think arrogance in the NY medical community led to NOT treating many patients and allowing them to die. The nursing home never said she had pneumonia, just fever, a little cough and she stopped eating. Then they put her on an IV for fluids. They never sent her to the ER or hospital. 16 days after telling me by phone that she &quot;Didn&#39;t feel well at all, she died. She was always sleeping after the day she told me she was sick and we couldn&#39;t visit because they stopped visits to Nursing Homes, and we never spoke to her again. Of course Gov. Cuomo banned visitors to protect the residents and then put recovering covid19 patients inside the Nursing Homes and Developmentally disabled homes. Cuomo killed over 5,000 Nursing Home residents. After all, the hospitals got $39,000 for every death they labeled as Wuhan Coronavirus death. Can you explain?"
My dog is named Dexter and I’ve always called him that lol.
I think I raised the use of IV corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for patients presenting with moderate/severe SARS CoV2 infections a month or two ago.
"Thank you for your bringing the best actual science and common sense I have been able to find.  You explain patiently to the layman and have A-list guests who do the same.  You have helped me sort through the chatter to stay current and make decisions for myself, my family, and how to be part of my community.  You worked through unimaginable exhaustion and shared with us online while things have been moving too fast to keep track.<br><br>I missed having grownups around during the community closures.  You and Dr. Yo are valuable friends and allies in facing Covid 19.  Your older vlogs addressing everyday health are also helpful and encouraging in these strange times."
"It has been used IV for covid for more than two months in Brazil, but only in the second stage of the disease!"
"Dexamethasone I read that doctors prescribe this drug for altitude sickness which I assume is fluid in the lungs? I know nothing about medicine, does this enable the gaseous exchange to continue in the alveoli by pushing the fluid back into the tissues?"
"I really like watching ur videos, u seem extremely educated in medicine and seem to know what ur talking about and I also like how you just tell the facts and it isn&#39;t some plot or political agenda! Thank you for all the great information in this scary time in the world and for all you do!!! It gives me hope that we will beat this coronavirus one day knowing we have people like you out there fighting for us to get through this!!! God Bless and Stay Safe 🙏"
"Swedish Epidemiologist Professor Johan Giesecke :- &quot;Why Lockdowns Are The Wrong Policy.&quot;<br>A man who is well worth listening to &amp; who really does know what he is talking about.<br>Some direct quotes from Professor Johan Giesecke :-<br>&quot;Covid-19 is a &quot;mild disease&quot; and similar to the flu, and it was the novelty of the disease that scared people.<br>The actual fatality rate of Covid-19 is the region of 0.1%.<br>At least 50% of the population of both UK and Sweden will be shown to have already had the disease when mass antibody<br>testing becomes available.&quot;<br>As of 5th June, 2020 there has been 391, 732 deaths worldwide from Covid-19.<br>Last year in 2019 from the seasonal flu there were 1/2 million deaths worldwide (with widespread vaccinations.)"
What about hydroxychloroquine in combination with zinc n antibiotic for early stages?
"Doc Hansen - please look into the US Patented Fabunan AntiViral Injection for Dengue, HIV, snake bite - among other things.  This injection is a mixture of Dexamethasone and an anesthetic. It has to be that mixture in order for it to be effective. Family of doctors (siblings) - the Fabunans - have been using this for years and have found them to be effective. The sad part is - their country (Philippines) - have not given them a chance to go on trial. Please look into the patent. Thanks."
"According to the unbiased news, Corona Virus Protests did not cause any increase (i.e. spike) in cases.  The Experts did not anticipate this, therefore the virus is OBVIOUSLY smarter than we originally thought. It clearly does not spread with protests.  On the other hand, we see increases in infection for the past few weeks.  Logically, it lead us to come to the conclusion these increases can only come as the direct result of Trump  rallies.  Again, these SMART CORONA VIRUSES understand its collective BRANDING: the elimination of  CONSERVATIVES is the ultimate goal of the left."
"Montelukast can reduce certain viral lung infection symptoms by 20%. I reached out to the man who led the researcher back in March and he said they hadn’t gotten ahold of Covid-19 to test, but that they hoped it could potentially help. It’s a common asthma medication and it is cheap. I def got a refill when this all started."
Doctors at my health care provider are using this and claim it reduces the death rate.
All over aFLU that has caught the world out and they shall never admit it as would question the value of FLU vaccination!?------Exercise Cygnus 2016 findings showed that the UK was not in a fit state to deal with a coronavirus type pandemic and seemingly all corners and political parties of UK knew this but kept it out of public knowledge.<br>Advisors to Tory and SNP political animals broke guidelines they were setting for the public!<br>Advisors to Tory and SNP political animals spoke of deaths in the elderly and both moved elderly from hospitals to care homes and in some cases maybe death. It raises the honesty of doctors/NHS managers etc that allowed this and sure asks of the value of the Hippocratic Oath that they are meant to take!?
FAI is used in the philippines for over 35 yrs now using dexa and now being finalised in indonesia. Try to search about FAI (fabunan antiviral injection)

"So, this treatment is only for severe cases, whereas if they survive they would have to lived with long term or even permanent health problems such as scarred  lungs and other damage organs."
Eye candy!
I  suspect its success not will depend not on whether it is effective or not. but whether it is still in patent or not
Doctor Mike thank you very much for the information. But I have one area of disagreement. When you are discussing the different types steroids that we use you tended to seem to lump them all together and I think you also grossly downplayed how very very serious these drugs can be. Yes they can be Lifesavers in a lot of situations but they can also have incredibly bad side effects as they directly interact with the hormones and other systems in our bodies. Talk to anyone who is taking corticosteroids for a long. Of time and get their reaction of how they think the drug works for them. Be very careful when you are recommending drugs to a very very large audience that you make sure and give them both sides of the issue.
dont stop your videos. They are excellent
Your information is very splendid 😊😊
I just wanted to say Hi Doc Mike :)
Antiinflamatories (as simple as ibuprophen!!!! are being used in latin America to treat covid for a while now and very successfully) USA has been slow to catch up with this logical medicine step to control the inflamation response 🤦🏻‍♀️
I hope CCP will not steal this idea..
I wish U and all Thor colleges understood Spanish or at least Italian. In Argentina ( Spanish country) they develop a liquid Ibuprofen that U can inhale and will cure covid patients in 3 days.  They already test it The Goverment us producing it. Argentina is the country that first identify the DNA of the virus we sent the information to WHO and it was approved as valid. Why U don&#39;t seem to have all these info? Check Cordoba states laboratories. as in provincia de Cordoba If u can&#39;t find anything u will have to change your server IP. Check with some IT friend.
dexamethasone+ .........  i can&#39;t say (there is a study from 2011) if you know the answer then .........
I want to take part in the trial.... I live in India
Oh man. They are salivating at the mouth to inject people. Charge thousands. Everyone talking about it.<br>No one wants it. Therapeutics are the way. Not some franken shot.
"Yes good news for keeping people from dying (no warranty) this is not to cure or stop the problem right away (like the one in Australia) treatment , treatment treatment the key (good luck in usa because the have a number they will try to keep regardless (they won&#39;t admit you) so you will deal with the virus on your own at your house and some people won&#39;t make on time when they get complications (that wouldn&#39;t happen if they are being monitored by a doctor )"
Dexamethasone was already being used 35 year ago and as one key ingredient to cure viràl deseases in the philippines the Drug name is FAI ...
Thank you
"If you think Dexamethasone is the new Covid-19 wonder drug, think again. If you&#39;re circling the drain in a high risk group and on a vent with ARDS (Acute respiratory distress syndrome) and COVID-19, now a recent study has come out as a last ditch effort to save you which is a steroid from 1957 called Dexamethasone, never mind all the other complications you will be battling including permanent lung damage or fibrosis, stroke, multiple organ failure of the heart, kidneys, and brain, with significant health impacts that may last the rest of your life after getting over the infection in addition to mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, this is little more than false hope."
"After having covid, i approve of this message"
"I think it will be very interesting to see research in coming years about how SARS COV-2 affects plant based population... People who eat plant based generally have very low inflammatory markers without compromising their immune system. In fact, by eating plant based you will generally eat very high amounts of antioxidants which will, theoretically, help your immune function."
what do you think of using melatonin instead? Should be much safer. The MATH+ protocol using this as part of their Covid protocol
"Thank you so much for these videos, they are clear, and easy to follow. Its hard to know these days who to listen to so at work, I&#39;m an  RN, I pass your  name and channel around to everyone I talk to for current and most importantly accurate information.  You&#39;ve helped me so much during all this."
How long it takes to recover  completely from covid ?
Does covid causes irreversible damage  in the body ?
GREAT direction here! This has proven to be valuable in a trial in the UK!
"Sesamestreet it down for some of us, please."
"I lost a lot of respect for the scientific community during this whole pandemic. Way too many suppositions, personal opinions based on zero facts but on biases and politics. At the start there was an attitude that steroids could never help so why even try. We also saw a clear lack of understanding of biochemistry and mechanisms of how drugs work. The fact that these authors dismissed HCQ did not seem to understand that HCQ is not what stops the virus but it is Zinc that stops virus MRNA replication. But zinc cannot enter into the cells due to its charged state. HCQ is only a means to get zinc into the cell. I don’t understand why the authors of this trial did not comprehend that or were not open to test that claim. Did the studies and cases from France back in April mean nothing.? The scientific community has not handle this pandemic well."
THANK GODNES!!! ! 🤲🏻

Here in the Philippines its already being used by a doctor for viral infections for 35 years already.  I think the breakthrough was 35 years ago it has been issued its patent is the US a long time ago.
add procane
The hurdle with use of dexamethasone in  Asia and Africa is that they need to be admitted to a hospital first which is a huge road block. So those poor souls are going to luck out and pass away anyway without any benefit derived from dexamethasone.
Dr. Hansen you come across as a bit of a steroid worshipper.  Term  &quot;major breakthrough&quot; can not properly be  attached at least to COVID19  especially when we have no clue on the long term outcome of those critically ill patients a handful of whom might be lucky to get discharged from the ICU due to dexamethasone. The only miracle of this chemical known to medicine is that in Giant Cell Arteritis.  Otherwise steroids are two edged weapons. Addisons disease is another story of course
"Doctor Mike Hansen- So good to hear some &quot;good news&quot;, now using a mask...wearing masks- isn&#39;t this dangerous for use 8 hrs a day? We are breathing in CO2??? I feel for all these workers indoors and using that mask all day long, won&#39;t that weaken their immune system?"
Have you read about the side effects of DeX used for SARS?
"Sorry to be a doubting Thomasina, but two months ago we were told steroids were the kiss of death w/COVID.  So I will await the results of more than this one trial (which had a number of questionable aspects) before lauding decadron from the rooftops.  TBH I have become untrusting of even &quot;reputable&quot; scientists at this point , everything and everyone has a political agenda waiting in the wings."
"dexamethasone and Procaine are the main ingredients of Fabunan antiviral injection by the Fabunan doctors for COVID 19. This is not a major breakthrough because Fabunan doctors used it for more than 35 years treating EBOLA, SNAKES BITE, SARS COVE, AND THE LATEST COVID 19 but it was ignored by the PHILLIPINES DOH, FDA, DOST. According to them, it was illegal to use for COVID 19. They padlock the Fabunan medical clinic and the license to operate was cancel. Many of their COVID 19 patients were crying."
Great news doctor..
Great news doctor..
"My brother in law passed from acute necrotizing pancreatitis last night. He had a sister who battled Covid-19 for a month in hospital, two weeks on a ventilator, before beating it. He entered the hospital five days ago. Docs did not diagnose Covid-19 by swab and refused to test further for fear that a positive diagnosis would have greatly hindered his treatment. They did not autopsy, and I don&#39;t know if they tested his pancreas after death. Consequently, his extended family has a false sense if security. Would this steroid have done anything whatever to help him?"

All the medical jargon gives me a headache!
steriods are not safe to use but most of physicians in newyork and worldwide use steriods because it decrease the oxgyen requirement in critically ill coviid-19 patients. <br>THEN HOW IT CAUSES DEATH ??<br><br>see complete research @bulletin263
"In the philippines, they have been using to treat covid19 before the study in UK, not sure what is the name of the doctor who started using dexamethasone. Dr Fabunan antiviral injection"
"I&#39;m not a doctor at all but with the limited things I know about the drugs, I have a question.<br><br>If this drug reduces inflammation at the potential expense of increasing the infection, why wouldn&#39;t it be given WITH Remdesivir to prevent the virus from multiplying (which is the point of the drug) while also reducing the inflammation with Dexamethasone?"
Signify (Philips) and Boston University validate effectiveness of Signify’s UV-C light sources on inactivating the virus that causes COVID-19.<br><br>@t<br><br>I all I think this is a very important to fight contamination of Sars-cov-2
"The current hyper-vigilance mandating onerous restrictions  hoping to mitigate transmission of the virus is wholly counterproductive. Epidemiology models predict a burnout of the viral infection rate limiting its spread incrementally over time.  Allowing broad dissemination for the purposes of establishing an antibody broad base threshold across the entirety of our population. <br>continuing the sequestration and isolation will only hinder the virus from replicating across the populace preventing the accumulative immunity as witnessed by the burn out of the (2004) viral outbreak... (2004)SARS-CoV-1 This iteration of the virus worked its way through society unencumbered establishing a broad base antibody dissemination across the population thereby eliminating its presence entirely.  The current rendition of the virus is no different than the last,   the same rules apply&#39; what we&#39;re allowing to take place by these overreaching restrictions will simply prolong the agony and put many many more lives at risk over time.  Now with (Covid-19) manifestation of (SARS-CoV-2) having not been given the latitude for dissemination&#39; will only prolong the agony  hanging around much longer than it would have if had not instituted so many restrictive encumbrances."
"This drug has been introduced in our country Philippines by a Filipino Doctor since 1975. The Fabunan Doctors trying to provide the information that it can be cure for severe or ill covid related patients but no one is noticing. I was wondering when UK acknowledged this drug on social media, other countries publicly noticed and put claimed on what this drug can do."
In philippines 30 years they allready invented atidote to corona virus by doctor ruben fabunan  he is drug designer he have usa patent fabunan anti viral injection  combi drugs dexamethasone procaine glucocorticoids
"The Fabunan doctors used dexamethasone in the philippines for 35 years with other drug to fight against malaria,snakebites and HIV aids virus they call it FAI (Fabunan antiviral injection)"
thanks for videos videos videos 🙂👍👍👍👍👍
Has any data been released to review?
Thanks Gud 🙏🙏
It is Great news. Thanks for the info. Can you repeat those 5 medications in the beginning 5 times FAST?
fabunan is right:)
Great job. Few friends in Brazil are using it with great results. We didn’t use it in our practice. Let see how that will guinde us. Thank you <br>Pete
Dexamethasone (Decadron) was prescribed to me for a month after an ICU hospitalization with a diagnosis of encephalitis (from CaT-scan) which was later corrected to be Subdural Hematoma on MRI.  My orthopedist confirmed to me that Decadron has a well known side-effect of causing Avascular-Necrosis of the hip-joint (which I developed and received a Total-Hip Replacement years later)
Thank u very much doctor. God bless u....you also HAPPY....
Search for FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION......
"Dexamethasone is one of the components to treat viruses like cov19. But FYI Scientist Doctor Ruben Fabunan (Philippines) discovered Dexamethasone more than 35 years ago as one of the components to treat Poison Venom (Snake Bite), HIV-AIDS, and many more. As the coronavirus outbreak, the Fabunan family doctor already knew the cause of these viruses because they have a deeper understanding of viruses. As the coronavirus outbreak, the voluntary covid19 patients who tried the anti-viral injection were cured But in the Philippines, there are some forces who are trying to stop the development of this anti-viral injection, they even banned one of the ingredients for this Fabunan Anti-Viral Injection. Some forces are using media so that the will not believe in this anti-viral injection.  What they did, they went to INDONESIA and Head of the Health Department and some doctors supported the Fabunan Anti-viral Injection. This month or next month they will hold international meetings together with other countries to discuss this Fabunan anti-viral injection matter.  FUN FACT: Before the Fabunan went to Indonesia the USA and ITALY government, already called the Fabunan Doctors and discuss the anti-viral injection. Why? because they already knew about this before. In fact, the Fabunan opened a company in the USA before but the BIG PHARMA/Company blocked them. Research on your own for more details. Cheers guys!"
awesome. how to be you Doc? 😍
so Remdesivir + Dexamethasone = Greater than 50% survivability for serverly ill Covid? Even Greater?
now let&#39;s see if the main stream media will report this good news...
"I am RN with asthma. I am  often working in Arctic, and quite often prednisone p.o. is helping to lower severity of my asthma attacks. Thank you Dr. Hansen! Please continue to inform us !"
Catching up ... thanks for educating
"west virginia medical school comment: &quot;notwithstanding the very important result of the recovery dexamethazone study, methylprednisolone is the corticosteroid of choicefor the pulmonary phase of covid 19 ...pharmacokinetic better lung penetration) , genomic data specific for sars cov 2 ,  and a long track record of succesful use in inflamatory lung deseases &quot;"
"Thank You Dr. Hansen, very informative and so happy you are on YouTube., Thank you !!"
This only treats symptoms of disease.
THIS IS NOT MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE PHILIPPINES....ALREADY DICOVERED BY DOCTOR FABUNAN 3 DECADES AGO.
"Dr pls research  Dr Fabunan Injection from Philippines.. he offered this injection as anti -Covid to the Phil gov’t but rejected it ..DEXAMETHASONE and PROCAINE are some of the ingredients of  the injection...People who were affected and was injected claimed that they felt the good result in just few days....his clinic was shut down by FDA so i didnt go thru.. instead they were called by Indonesian Ministry of Health and will be waiting for the final results of the clinical trial on June 29, 2020..."
🇿🇦👏
"let&#39;s be honest, people have been using both solu-medrol and dexa for these patients, so its not as it is ground breaking per se, but rather we now have data to back up the use. The concern with viral disease is that if you give it too early -&gt; prolonged viral replication, so there was some hesitancy. One of the early retropesctive studies from China did show mortality benefit in ARDS patients for steroids"
Handsome
Wounderful news Dr Hansen! God bless you with wisdom! 🙏😇

"Hi,<br>Some months ago I had s*x with the third guy in my life whom i was about to marry and now I have herpes. I couldn’t believe it because he wasn’t a random guy, he’s the closet guy I’ve had as a boyfriend, but it has been a never ending nightmare since. I’ve always believed in GOD and have asked him for forgiveness which is ironic.<br>I felt like killing myself with the taught of having a husband and family will be quite difficult and i felt like I’m not really in the room when people are talking. I didn’t know what to do and pretty much cry and pray every day to God for help and looking at my family with so much love and feeling that i have disappointed them even though they don’t know. Until God lead me to DR. IZAZA online who promised to help me cure my disease through herbals. At first i didn&#39;t believe him, but to my greatest surprise i was cured completely by herbals, which medical doctor also verified that i was cured. Special thanks to DR. IZAZA.<br>Don&#39;t be discourage because he that did it for me will also do it for you and you can contact him through his email address (DRIZAZAHERBALCUREHOME@GMAIL.COM) or text him on WHATSAPP phone number +2348103355314"

"Thank God, finally good news, God bless you!! Dr.💖🙏🏼💝"
"You said that there is no way to determine who will go on to develop serious or worse symptoms with COVID-19. THAT IS NOT TRUE! As early as March, Dr. Thomas Yadegar, ICU Director at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in California demonstrated a way to predetermine which patients would develop complications. He ameliorated their disease before it turned deadly and prevented them from needing ventilators. Isn&#39;t it better to prevent patients from going on ventilators in the first place rather than treating them after they are on ventilators? Of course it is! Sir William Osler, one of the four founders of John Hopkins Hospital understood this when he wrote, &quot;The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease&quot;. I think that more physicians should seriously consider adopting Dr. Yadegar&#39;s approach to curing COVID-19 to further validate his results. Prevention IS a cure."
i did not uderstand have the things you said but you just made my day
That drug is being pushed here in the Philippines for months already!
Didn&#39;t WHO tell you guys to not use steroids...
Thank you so much for caring! ❤
Thank you doc.. it will help me in my pharma exam
I hope you can check FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION was created 35 years ago by a FILIPINO inventor from the PHILIPPINES.... it has a component of DEXAMETHASONE and PROCAINE which is blocked by PHILIPPINES HEALTH DEPT to be noticed as possible medical help to covid19 patient.... this drug was made by A FILIPINO DR. FABUNAN....
"Interesting and worthwhile video.     This corticosteroid is not a cure, but merely another medication in the arsenal for specialized use as needed, for the time being.   Thank you for the video post."

"Having had neurosarcoid, initially diagnosed as MS, for over 30 years, I have considerable experience as a patient with corticosteroids, and I&#39;ve found that doctors, or at least American neurologists, prescribe oral prednisone far, far more often than dexamethasone. I was curious, therefore, why the steroid used in this trial was dexamethasone rather than &quot;pred.&quot; Does the nationality of the doctors explain it, or is there a medical reason?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrwSo9ZDZEg&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> treatment for Mild cases ..keep us posted. Thanks Doc👍"
64 dislikes are covid bacteria
Thanks for the info Dr. Mike.
"I agree, <br>Dexamethasone has no activity against virus. That is why there was no benefit seen by use on mild cases. It was used mainly for to treat ARDS, and why its use showed best response in cases with severe cases, on ventilator. <br>We need to wait for study results from clinical trials involving high dose dexamethasone."
"Why is it used in 8 clinics in the UK for gender changing in children and adults for chemical castration, check the safety data sheets it is hydrogen fluoride, used in rocket fuel and jet fuel also used in domestic gas it is also used in the flu vaccines, it is highly volatile and corrosive very explosive, it is used for changing the gender of babies in the whom it is also used in clitoral growth in men, that is all we need a man with two pairs of lips. this killer drug has never been approved once it enters the body it turns into hydrofluoric acid and it will kill you. I cannot believe it is allowed remember Doctor Shipman when he killed over 250 pensioners using the same chemicals. this is only part of the story. they also use hydrogen fluoride in antidepressant toothpaste. colgate say no more."
I just want to say you are not right virus can&#39;t be treated by man made thing
"IT WAS A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH 35 YEARS AGO BY A FILIPINO SCIENTIST DOCTOR RUBEN FABUNAN&#39; S ANTIVIRAL INJECTION DRUG...IT IS A U.S. PATENTED DRUG ( SEARCH GOOGLE). RIGHT NOW IT IS UNDERGOING CLINICAL TRIALS &amp; OBSERVATIONS IN INDONESIA.. MAIN COMPONENTS OF HIS INVENTED DRUG ARE DEXAMETHASONE, PROCAINE &amp; ALCOHOL...IT HAS POSITIVE RESULTS SO FAR &amp; DONT GET SURPRISED IF IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED AS THE CURE FOR COVID19.!!!"
It&#39;s good in severe asthma too
"I’ve heard that sometimes steroid meds can cause high blood sugar in type 1 diabetics.  Does this drug do that?  And if so, would a doctor avoid prescribing it for a type 1 on a ventilator?"
So trashing the immune system helps
This is encouraging development that can offer a sense of safety.  Thanks for keeping us informed.  😃
why this news is not popular yet how many victims get  healhty by this medicine
Very well explained Doctor mike...God bless
Dexamethazone is right it helps a lot.
So sad for this lockdown and 400k deaths without knowing this cheap steroid.
That&#39;s great news 😀 how about the Remdesiver  ? Thank you in advance as you take up another video doctor Hansen
Very cheap drugs that can cure coronavirus thanks God
Great news!!! Please colab with Dr Mike Varshavsky 😃
Thank you!
"So, hopefully if I or anyone like me, will get this med and hopefully it will help us to get better. I have Asthma/Copd. I don&#39;t like how the corticosteroids feel, but for this I will take it. Thank you so much for the information Dr. Mike."
How about treating out immune systems with a healthy diet!
&quot;Fabunan Anti-Viral Injection&quot; are composed of PROCANE &amp; CORTICOSTEROID/DEXAMETHASONE as an Anti-Inflammatory.Made in the Philippines..
"pneumonia caused by a cytokine storm therefor Dexamethasone is very effective use in mild case before it cause cytokine storm that cause pneumonia the reason more of patient dies because of pneumonia ,<br><br>Dexamethasone is a breakthrough , your wrong"
Hydroxycholorouine with zinc is still needed !!!!!!!
therefor Dexamethasone  will be given to a milder before severe. to save life
They are saying that it improves survival rate by around 30% for people that are severe enough to have ended up on a ventilator.
Corticosteroids been a life saver for me as a Neprotic Syndrome Patient.

they can&#39;t come up with anything
The doctor has very well with his speech I get tongue-tied in half of those words and very interesting to listen to
Sir please explain how in simple words to me how its helpful
"I have a question to you doctor, but before I ask I need to understand something that could be a point of consideration. We are seeing several medications that&#39;s  helping a number people with covid-19, my question is: like the HIV virus we know that is no cure for it, but what make the life of the person prolong for many years (I  hope I am correct)  why not make a  Cocktail of all those medications that is working right now such as ivermectin, Dexamethasone and so forth to help people survive covid-19?"
Thank you for sharing this important information😷
Thanks Dr Mike that sounds like it could be good newsxx
"Good news are always welcome.<br><br>I gotta add though: the channel of Mike Hansen inadvertently comes hand in hand with the other Dr Mike channel (search wise). They&#39;re both medical related and both watched heavily, now in the time of crysis. However, Mr Hansen is always so serious and scientific, that an average person might loose himself in the terminology.<br>I wonder: if the scientific presentation would have been tuned down a bit, would this channel reach more audience? 🤔<br><br>Regardless: good job, and thank you for the good news!"
I am not a medical student..I can&#39;t even understand the terms that you mentioned in this video..<br>And when I read the comments I am just feeling like I am an alien😂<br>But I am happy that Medicines that works against Covid-19 are getting better day by day<br>Hats off to all the medical workers ❤
Should you take a double dose if going to a rally later in the day?
"Why weren&#39;t steroids tried earlier to reduce the lung inflammation. I use it during asthmatic bronchitis coupled with antibiotics. I realize antibiotics aren&#39;t appropriate for viral infections, however, antiviral with steroid is always effective as used during viral mengitis which I contracted several years ago."
Not buying anything on the media. Our world is done up. New world order with technology improving.
Outcomes are better but I wouldn&#39;t describe this as a &quot;Major Breakthrough&quot;.
Based on a recent info yeah mate you really do know what that is init why dont you consume the tablet yourself

"Hi thank you for this video. As I understand it, this particular drug has also been tried for Sars 1, Mers and Ebola - without any result. Could you give an explanation why this drug seems to have an effect on covid-19 patients. As you say in the video, the drug shows promising results in the suppression of cytokine storms, but aren&#39;t these storms the same in people suffering from the other mentioned viruses? Thanks"
Exactly!! was a good news 👍👍💖 Amen!!<br>Thanks sir 👍👍
Why is this news?  Who doesn’t know that steroids reduce inflammation.  I’ve been saying all along they should be using them to keep the cytokine storm from happening
Dr  Mike  why you  call it  major  breakthrough  this  drug is  available  from  ages I am  allergic  <br>Asthmatic  I get  symbicort  inhalation  puffs for  my  allergies  asthma <br>Before  in the E R I use  to get  decadron  shots I use to get  relief  in hours  then one  dr warn me  baljit  be careful  it will  give you  osteoporosis  and withdrawal symptoms  too  I use to get  dizzy after  3 months or so  but  it helps me  lot dr   if you  could  shed some  light       thanks. Baljit
"insightful, honest and informative video from Dr Hansen, plus I think his handsomeness is an added bonus."
Thank you for explaining that. 😉
🙏
Isnt it obvious? Also for secondary infections. But secondary infections is a risk of steroids.
Dr. Mike! Thanks for all the info...Youre thee man...
Finally a glimmer of light.
"Dr. Mike, I suffer from RA and take Plaquenil and Methotrexate, obviously my body is already suffering from high inflammation, should I be worried about Cytokines storm due to my condition if I were to get the virus?"
"You&#39;re right we have to wait and see what happens, but I do believe dexamethasone will work."
This is great news hope it really plays out so it can help a lot of people. Anything that  can help until we have a viable vaccine that everyone can aquire. <br>Thanks Dr.Hansen for keeping us informed with good information.
Why are you not putting the study in the description?
I think calling it a &quot;Major Breakthrough&quot; is as irresponsible as President Trump calling that other drug a &quot;Game Changer.&quot;  It sounds more to me like &quot;a step of progress.&quot;
Love your honest videos!  They are so informative.
The CDC should hire this man.  He’s straight forward and asks good questions. When I was ill in late March I went from being fine one minute to hardly able to get oxygen the next. It hit me like a boulder to my chest.   The NYFD emts gave me oxygen to keep me from going to the hospitals which were slammed.  I had about 5 of these crazy episodes. My oxygen levels fell into the 50s and my pulse was like 180 the first time but I recovered back into the 90s.  The second time it wasn’t as bad - into the 70s and my pulse rate was in the 50s.  I started a twice daily powder lung med and used a nebulizer with Albuterol when I had an episode and I was able to breath through  them a bit like I did labor pains - but with the nebulizer and my breathing as my focus.  The steroid that I was given along with the Albuterol was stopped by a pulmonologist.  I couldn’t swallow (the motion)when I used it but I could swallow water but I think he was right to take me off that piece.  I think an overall steroid maybe could have helped but not a high dose.  If this would work for people earlier in the viral experience maybe it could cut down on severe cases. Without this it’s still a good piece for doctors to try and could help with other SARS infections in the future.  Thanks for your vlogs.
"🙏 takecare Dr. Mike as always,."
It&#39;s a start thank you
they more side effect from Dexamethasone being sick is better than continuous cough<br><br>i choose covid-19 than Dexamethasone due to the symptoms of Dexamethasone
"50 mgs. Of prednisone is what I receive for an Multiple sclerosis relapse. The pharmacy was afraid without checking with the neurologist because it&#39;s a massive dose. It&#39;s meant to shut off my immune system to stop the immune response, hence autoimmune disease. I&#39;m due for a massive dosing in 1.5.months to restart my medication after a pregnancy I was first afraid but after having and surviving covid in my 5th month of pregnancy I&#39;m not as afraid anymore. It was fucking awful and I was afraid I would die and my baby would. It took me 1.5 months recover and I lost 20 lbs in the time."
Thanks a lot for your clear and concise explanation on the use of Dexamethasone.
I’m a nurse. This isn’t rocket science that this drug would help. Persons were probably being treated with from the start.
Try again doc... does that work for the new mutations? 30% is not good enough.
Corticosteroids for a virus infection is really a big bet...since it suppresses the Immune System in a long run.<br>It&#39;s critical to know exactly when the Immune System switches from your friend into your enemy.<br>That&#39;s the time to start using that kind of drug.
"Great! But this drug can have some side-effects like low level libido, erectile dysfunction and infertility?! Well, little do the doctors know that when a patient on oxygen or on a ventilator; the oxygen concentration of just between 30-50%, increases the survival rate. Any oxygen concentration above 70% can cause COVID-19 to be more aggressive!"
"Yeah go UK, why do so many medicines have such impossibly difficult names?"
What about diabetics?   That Will drive their blood sugar off scale.
what about inhaled steroids if you have asthma and ciclesonide?
Finally some good news-- let&#39;s go for an even better treatment until the vaccines arrive...
Dangerous why
Does this mean that us asthma sufferers on pulmicort daily will have worse outcomes with covid or better? I take a lot of pulmicort daily 2 puffs twice a day for years for chronic asthma that is tipping to early copd.
I&#39;m a beneficiary of steroid use in cases where I need it for intervention.  I have APS and lupus and when I experience a &quot;flare&quot; up my Rheumatologist prescribes a Medrol Deepak which usually works to stop it.
I am shocked it wasn&#39;t tried in the beginning sometimes it is the only thing that gets me going short sharp dose
"Thank you for this, Doc."
"Does it help everyone, it has been tested for over (6 weeks) already."
We are heading to the right direction....
does that mean that mandatory vaccins is no more needed?
The emoji is fresh Doctor!
Thanks for your informative update.
"Great Britain currently is doing the world largest clinical trials for covid 19 treatments and this new study was just one of the dozens of studies taking place in Britain,  mostly in NHS hospitals ✌"
I guess I’m wondering why they didn’t try this from the beginning
"Is that safe, if you&#39;ve had cancer, any cancer, please?"

It’s funny because this medecation is made to suppress your immune system
"So good to have honest &amp; open videos. Thank you.  That said, I worry that the pharma powers may attempt to quiet you.  I say this put of love for fellow humans that aren&#39;t politically or monetarily motivated.  It would not be the first time that they would try to silence somebody from spreading grass roots basic medicine that detracts from their megadollar &quot;miracle drugs&quot; being currently worked on in labs."
"Was it some weeks ago, you were bashing on steroids (when taking turns to bash VitD dosage) for treating Covid? You&#39;re always demanding double-blind-triple-blind-randomized-clinical-studies before you talk about it, but now you&#39;re quick to run through the streets of Italy saying Eureka with a trial. With all the praise you gave Chloroquine, it is probably feeling dejected right now. Now dex is going to get scarce and expensive for those prescribed. The cherry picking of information continues."
"Clear &amp; thorough, as usual. Thanks !!!"
So happy!
Only fabunan doctor inventor use for 30 years but philippines ignore due to grab mentality
"Thank you, Dr. Hansen, for bringing us good news that we desperately needed it. A quick question, would it be beneficial instead of harmful if a person is already taking prednisone for other issues?"
"I was able to accurately surmise what it was doing, and why it was used.  That&#39;s not bad from mostly watching videos and no formal medical study IMO.  Just means on a very high level, I get the basics and it&#39;s because of videos from Doc Hansen and others. <br><br>If you use other social media share these videos, you never know the knowledge you gain may help save a life by dispelling misinformation."
Very informative  you teache us the most recent and advanced even  befor bublished .thank you so much.
If you have anti phospholipid syndrome does that make you more likely to die from covid?
Thank you
Prednisone saved my niece.
Steroids hmmmm 🤔not sure
"Hi! Great video! I was wondering if you could go more in depth of how the cytokine storm occurs with COVID-19? I have seen explanations of how cytokine storms occur with superantigens, but not specifically with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thank you!"
How exciting! Great news. I can tell youre happy Dr. Hansen!
Good news?! That&#39;s something I haven&#39;t heard in months! :D
Thanks for the informative updates Doc.
"steroids = immune suppression <br>anti inflamamories = reduce the bodies own inflammatory/healing response. If anyone gets better, it is DESPITE these drugs."
Horses on the track usually get a dexamethazone shot the day before they race.
This will raise blood sugar for diabetes- I wonder how it will affect diabetic covid patient
🤔🤔🤔
"Thank you! Finally, some good news!"
"Is this a cure to covid, or a cure to death by ventilator.."
Thank you Doc Mike for the info.
Does Dexamethasone contain Meth?
"What a GREAT SERVICE you are providing, Dr Mike! Thank You, Busy Guy!"
"Dexamethasone is not New in the context of managing acute illnesses. How about Blood Sugar/diabetic control .... many Covid cases are diabetics and glucocorticoids mess up blood sugar? Also, please discuss use of antihistaminics for moderate to severe Covid  respiratory symptoms if the inflammatory process in the lungs is due to a hypersensitivity reaction of the body"
I challenge ANYONE to say &quot;gluco-corticoid&quot; six times quickly...
"There is a Salvadorian Microbiology Doctor Maria Barrientos, that she is been telling about treating Covid patients with antinflamatory drugs like steroids, since day one . A lot of videos about her protocols in YouTube ."
Peer reviews don&#39;t fail me now! <br>- covid anxiety me
So since I have been on prednisone for 25 years.  I should be ok if I get covid.  Is that what u are saying
Thanks for the good work  you are doing .😊🙏👌😘

"Dang,who knew that steroids help people with inflammation in airway to breathe"
"I understand what you said, but I find it interesting that someone who is hospitalized may be thought to be suffering from a &quot;mild&quot; episode of the disease. It&#39;s all relative, I guess...."
steroids been used for years to control  hyper inflammation.<br>bit obvious really.. <br>only works in a third of cases... <br><br>in cytokine storm supressing the imunne system is a good idea.<br><br>Me and mi mate Dave said down the pub in January said this was the best solution. <br>But it&#39;s good news..
"Lots of complex words they name those drugs. Not sure i could ever lean to day them. Last winter I was sick. My lugs felt like they were full of water. Couldn&#39;t breathe deep. Age 71, I survive d Think my lungs are still damaged some from what I had. Had no fever and oxygen blood levels where fine but blood pressure was 212 / 100 . took a $12 Penicillin for 10 days."
Why is this good news? Most intensivists worth their salt would give steroids in ARDS/MOF anyway? Does this trial tell us anything we didn&#39;t know? It&#39;s not like any extra lives would be saved?
THANK YOU SO MUCH   DOC.HANSEN .CAN THIS  DEZAMETHASONE HELP KIDS TO?
"This is great news. However, Chloroquine has been tried and true for over 70 years and very successful in treatment of CV yet FDA pulled its use. This is murder."
"You are doing an awesome job of keeping up with all the media hype, explaining the good versus bad and true, not true. This done in a scientific but easy to understand language.  Thank you much!"
Thanks for effect sizes and dosages. What is the associated dose of oral prednisone?
I don&#39;t understand a lot of stuff but I do listen to all of the stuff!
"This is interesting AND scary.. it is common knowledge in the medical community that immonucompromised patients are more susceptible to viral infections, and what steroids do is suppress the immune system.. and now we have dexamethasone for corona virus."
Tell us about ENU200... is it the real cure ?
I feel a little smarter after watching this. Very informative. 👍🏾
This is not new for us Filipinos because this was already proven by Doctor Fabunan 35 years ago.
Great information doc! Thank you for sharing
"I just wish to know, overwhelmed with news that many patient have clotting problems related to covid. So can someone have asprin as a precaution and how much does will not harm for people who have peptic ulcers or other gastrointestinal problem. Also, I&#39;m diabetic since 2016, 42 years old now."
What about the effects of cannabis on the cb2? receptor? The anti inflammatory effects are possible treatment for COVID?
Beware Dexamethasone which caused me to develop Cushings!! It is immunosuppressive being a steroid so there’s clearly money to be made from it opposed to HCQ.
Thank you Doctor for the update. I am myself a Dentist and an asthmatic and have been using steroid inhalers for like 15 yrs for my allergies. It&#39;s so wonderful to receive this gud news. Maybe in future local steroid delivery in the lungs will become a new  treatment to improve the prognosis of this disease.
Thanks for the encouraging word ! Hopefully the FDA gets it out to the needy public soon !
"My grandfather, who died in 1992 of emphysema, received prednisone (a corticosteroid, related to the one mentioned here), which helped him to breathe. It is, indeed, a useful tool against severe inflammatory disease of many kinds. Not a miracle (he wasn&#39;t cured), but definitely a tool that enabled him to live several years after being diagnosed as terminal."
Commenting for support
"thank you si much for sharing, I just read it announced officially by WHO. God bless everyone, take care!"
Great vid many thanks
"Excellent video,  thanks Dr Mike."
Very well explained and I now ask whether the common asthma preventative (brown) inhalor that contains Beclometasone Dipropionate provides a modest degree of protection for asthmatics against the inflamatory reaction and cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 in the same way as stronger corticosteroids?
"I heard it wasn&#39;t really very impressive.  You can make anything look impressive manipulating statistics.  Seems like the studies are for expensive pharmaceuticals and not cheap treatments/preventatives like Vitamin D, Zinc, hydroxychloroquine, Pepcid, and NAC.  IOWs the aim seems to be to make money not find an effective treatment."
"Corticosteroids turned the tides for the SARS in 2004. But it seems there are long term side effects with patients suffering low quality of life. I just hope this time we will have truly good news.  Ref: Altered Lipid Metabolism in Recovered SARS Patients Twelve Years after Infection, Sci Rep 7, 9110 (2017)."
"During the 1918 pandemic &quot;cytokine storm&quot; is what killed so many young people. Haven&#39;t seen the data obviously, but my assumption would be that Dexa is more effective on younger patients for this reason."
Hi! What happens if i&#39;m allergic to Cortizone?
Just wondering: what happened to Leronlimab?
I am suspicious of why the CDC was until very recently recommending against steroids. Certain pulmonary critical care specialists and alums of the surviving sepsis campaign on the other hand were arguing that steroids all along do have an important role in therapy in published correspondences. The CDC also lied to the public blatantly about face masks. They have damaged their credibility to me and I am an allied health professional.

I clicked because I usually understand when you explain things-even with all the medical lingo. I also clicked because you were smiling and there was good news. We need good news!
"There are other treatments available. Why don&#39;t doctor use vit C &amp; NAC IVs for lung inflammation? Also can nebulize with mucomyst (NAC), a common drug."
Dose?????
I have learned so much from you Dr. H. <br>Thank you again.🙏
I think this is being oversold.  It helps some people.  I would not call this a &quot;major breakthrough&quot;.
"Hi Doc Mike ! Have you heard about Fabunan anti viral injection,?"
And it absorbs well through the skin.
Good to hear Dr Mike
👍🏼!
😘😘😘
Nothing new here.  The FLCCC reported this as part of their MATH+ protocol several months ago
"Its a food supplement, for glowing skin, for appetite enhancer?"
"in lieu of Dexamethasone, Methylprednisolone 16mg 2x a day could also exert same effects? Tnx"
Every answer brings 5 new questions... Thank you!
"All my life with asthma and common colds always turn into pneumonia.  Then i spend a month in ICU.   Always on prednisone,  or prelone (IV prednisone )<br>I&#39;ve been asking if covid patient&#39;s are being treated with prednisone.  Personally,  it let&#39;s me breathe,  keeps my lungs open and why not for covid?  Suppressing the immune system is good for cytokine storm<br>Another life saver,  c-pap and B-PAP"
He’s so  smart ! It’s so sexy ☺️
"Dr Hansen this is great news! Thanks again for your clear and concise description of the meaning of this study.<br>The obvious question to me that is begging to be answered is what does this mean (if anything) with regard to this whole class of drugs (Glucocorticoids) and in particular those steroids that use a similar anti-inflammatory process and/or have a similar structure? Based on cost and availability this drug is practically unbeatable, but does the results of the study suggest a way of looking at the problem that helps us to better understand how to address it?<br>Thank you for your time and consideration."
Here’s another drug that’s cheap and widely available:  Hydroxychloroquine <br>But the FDA made sure that we will never get it.  Thank you FDA!
Thank you so much Doc..
"These steroids are common, so easy to get. We should give it to people who test positive before they get ARDS."
I dont know for how long you practice before appearing ..... Very insightful and informative keep it up
"WOW, it took six fucking months for the medical community to discover that a corticosteroid can cure Covid!<br>We already knew that corticosteroids are the elderly&#39;s best friends.<br>In fact, many old people are literally addicted to them, because they make most ills disappear like magic."
Is it possible that doctors have been using this on severe patients in hospitals worldwide for the last couple of months?  The reason I ask is that it seems like the worldwide deaths are steadily decreasing while cases are still sharply rising.
"Really?? The FLCCC Working Group has been using the MATH+ protocol which uses methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin, along with zinc and some other co-interventions for a couple of months now with a bigger impact on mortality than what was presented in the dexamethasone report."
I have more confidence in the Zelenko protocol in an early treatment. There are no complications or Cytokine Storm.<br>Professor Peter Horby research has many failures and not honest.<br>So great news that it could decrease the deaths of a severe infection. <br>I want to hear NO deaths. 🙄<br>BTW Zinc sulphate must be used by all Covid-19 infected people to have no scars in your lungs.
"A few times, I was severely sick. I was given a shot of Decadron and it knocked it RIGHT OUT. I was better within 12 hours; and I mean, I felt like a million bucks! Glad something that has been on the market for years can help people recover from this illness."
Thank you
You need new shirts.
Doctor i have a question: does covid stay for 3 month without killin. cause i have the following pains for the last 3 month: 1. chest anf backpain 2. breathing problem. can u also direct me the medicines to use? please gve me an answer. tnx
"THANKS MUCH , DR. MIKE HANSEN"
"It really is about time for some good news. Very good news and easily available medicine, already well known by providers and on the shelves of every hospital pharmacy in the United States. That is a victory right there. Thank you for the video!"
Who thinks it WON&#39;T be approved in the US because its cheap?
"This is the regular flu, so is it still a good idea to give it?"
They are rediscovering the components of the already known HAT therapy for Sepsis.
"There is a medicine called FAI (Fabunan Antiviral Injection) formulated by a doctor named Ruben Fabunan, a Filipino.  He had it patented in the USA and had received an achievement award. He and his other siblings who are also doctors have been using this drug in the Philippines since 1975. During this Covid 19 pandemic, they have been offering to help the Philippine govt. with their drug, but to no avail. The reason -  the ingredients is a steroid - Dexamethasone. It took them 35 years to come up with a formula by searching for other drug to combine with Dexamethasone, and they found Procaine, an anesthetic. Because of the rejection experienced by their own government another country - Indonesia - who became aware of the FAI offered to host the testing trial for Covid 19 using the FAI. The Fabunan said that their formula cannot be copied (it is patented) or if it could, it will take years and years of experimentation. So far, the testing to actual patients with Covid 19 in Indonesia is showing positive and promising results. FAI has been effectively used in HIV, snake bites, Dengue, and more. Check out on YouTube on the controversial issues and other things about FAI in the Phil. (Note: The Fabunan said that their cocktail of drugs produces a synergistic effect once inside the body. (what is &quot;synergistic? )The Fabunan (through Mr. Mario Marcos, their spoke person) have received so many inquiries from other countries, including London, about this FAI drug. The WHO has already noted this drug, and this  29th of June, 2020, there will be a worldwide conference about it."
"Isn’t it all about timing? Too soon and you risk dampening the immune system. But if you are too late into the storm  it may not really help. Also, were physicians seriously not using this even when people’s O2 started to decrease and CRP and d-dimers started to increase?"
"Woohoo.. that makes me happy because I am so afraid of Covid esp since I have Adrenal Insufficiency. I take HC daily and of course have dexamethasone in pill form/injection in case of an emergency. I must admit over the years I have had so many reactions to other people&#39;s cigarettes smoke, cheap and not cheap perfume, diesel and other sense would send me into coughing spasms and loss of voice for a while or a day. Hydrocortisone has taken away this sensitivity to smells and scents Good or bad"
God bless the scientists. 🙏🙏❤❤
"search FAI in the Philippines this use in 35yrs until now this medecine is cure for all kind f virus like covid19 and  ebola., snake venum, sinose, HIV, dengue, and etc... This FAI is now going to indonesia to use People have covid. I hope you research about FAI in the Philippines but the problem is the Philippines Government not give attention of this FAI not give chance to test thats why the filipino inventor medecine dr. Fabunan is proced to indonesia.. This medecine or call FAI is cure all kind of sick."
All it would take is for President Trump to say this drug has shown benefits in the treatment of the CCP virus and the rats would crawl out of the sewer and condemn this drug.
"A bit nonsensical. Mortality from 41.4 to 28% deaths. Doesn&#39;t that say something about poor initial treatment in the UK. In Malaysia the treatment for all positive patients is hydroxychloroquine, early and the result is mortality rate of 1.7%."
Any truth to the idea that the ventilators do more harm (due to &#39;pressure&#39;) than just using oxygen therapy ?<br>I have heard this several times. The consensus is ventilators are &#39;life support&#39; from which one rarely survives.<br>Huge fan of your intelligent and informative videos. Thanks.
"Everyone, share this video before it gets deleted!!!"
Thanks a million for taking the time to get us this vital information👍🏻❤️🙏🏼
Think you should do a follow up on hydroxychloroquine
Ian a spanish doctor. Realy happy with these results. We have been using empirically corticosteroids for Covid 19 pneumonia  particular y
"When I&#39;ve first seen news about that, I thought it was just old news revamped to increase sales, but thanks for making it clear that Dexa is indeed good NEW news. <br>Greetings from Brazil. :-)"
What would be the effect of dexametasol to those who have myasthenia gravis and been under prednisone(tapered 20-30mg) for 7yrs. And contracted covid? Please reply. Thnks.
Thank you!  Keep the videos coming. People seem to think Covid is gone.  You are providing the most accurate information!!!
"Reading through the comments, it seems like other countries are quicker to use what might work, than our country is.  Why do our official organizations poo poo everything so quickly ???"
"I am glad this was studied. One question and one thought. <br><br>Question. Is there any data on how people on maintenance steroid regimes  eg anti-rejection drugs or perhaps rheumatoid arthritis drugs have fared?  <br><br>Thought. I appreciate protocols but are they too restrictive at times especially when with reasonable controls perhaps lower doses, the risk can be reduced to try a mechanism like immunosuppressants on a more idiosyncratic basis esp when the patient is not responding. Where does/has the immunologists stand/stood on Covid vs infectious disease.  Seems like depending on the stage of the patient, our perspective and perhaps the diagnosis needs to be ‘distinctly’ vs, and in contrast to, ‘progressively’ different. This is going through my mind and I may be completely off base. In any case, thank you for being a teacher and healer."
"I&#39;m not understanding what&#39;s so breaking about this news. Steroids, vitamin c, and zinc have been treatment for covid in my area for 2 months"
It would be useful to have a link to the study in the description.
Thank you Dr. Mike !
So handsome Doc. Thanks for the info
be free<br>get wiser<br>be that
Thank you for your research and explanations.
I look forward to your informative vids. Thank you for the essential work you do!
Big pharma right now: &quot;dam it dam it dam it dam it dam it!&quot;<br>Everyone: haha
"Im one of the research nurses in the UK who recruited patients and collected data for this drug trial. The RECOVERY trial also gave more evidence that Hydroxychloroquine does not have clinical benefit to Covid19 patients. This early report for Dexa was good news to our team but we obviously welcome a peer review to validate the data that has been collected. At the moment the remaining treatment arms that we are recruiting consists of Azithromycin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Tocilizumab, and Convalescent plasma."
Thank you.
This is the best news since you grew back your scruff! Growl 😘
Thanks for presenting this information.  Corticosteroids can be lifesaving drugs. They do have side effects and you didn&#39;t mention any of those.  People need to be fully informed 😊
"I suffer with asthma and when I have an attack my doctor gives me prednisolone and I normally have to take 40 mg a day for 5 days.  I had the flu in December and was breathless and was prescribed prednisolone and I got better after three days, who knows maybe it was the covid19. <br>I’m glad you made this video because I was asking just yesterday if prednisolone was in the same family of Dexamethasone.   Thank you for this update great news."
This is good news. Too bad we weren&#39;t psychics and stocked up on this drug in advance! I&#39;m sure it will shortly not be cheap
Fabunan doctors already used this drug mixed with other ingredients  they used it for almost 30 years..
"My father had stage 4 lung cancer, he died January 5th 2019. I remember my dad was taking Dexamethasone, from what I know that is a pain killer for people with cancer. If this pain killer helps to reduce the pain in cancer patients, people taking the vaccine, what does it do exactly? Are there any side effects?"
Looking forward to more info!
hi  . is there any method by which you can determine a persons  immunity  level ...  i think this will help in determining  an individual&#39;s response  to treatment  .
"since you wrote GOOD NEWS, I even watched the ads ALL THE WAY in the beginning!  Thank you, you have been very honest, without being political.  I&#39;ve been able to highly recommend you to friends.  And share. your posts."
Thank you doctor for keeping us up to date.
"Thank u Doc for ur conscientious help, all the way from the Philippines! 🇵🇭👏🎉💝"
"It&#39;s one of the components of Fabunan drugs being used in managing viral infections here in the Philippines. However, the FDA did not approve it."
Man I&#39;d love to work with you Dr. Hansen! Great presentation.
I have been told by 3 doctors to stay or continue Prednisone 5mg for life.
Great update &amp; presentation to help us understand. 😎
What is not yet clear is what happened IF the non-ventilated group then went on to ventilators. How was that recorded and what were the outcomes?
the best way to fight virus is eucalyptus oil many drops in hot water every night = neutralize virus hours after you get it  empty lungs of all air breathe through nose slowl y all the way to bottom of lungs  i truely feel this has worked for me i will ask my doctor for anti body test so ii know for sure      =   doctor be a hero and discover this and present it to world
Very Insightful. Exactly what my RA doctor said.
God bless you Doctor thank you so much for this video 🙌🏾♥️🙌🏼♥️💙♥️💙
"So , the elderly won&#39;t die now from COVID19, they will die from Dexamethazone internal bleeding ?"
You said vaping lung injury without specifying that it&#39;s vaping illicit THC oil laced with vitamin E that has caused those handful of cases.
Thank you! Love your videos
YES! Thank you Dr. (｡♡‿♡｡)

"While we are all waiting on a vaccine, perhaps other doctors should adopt Dr. Thomas Yadegar&#39;s approach to a cure for COVID-19 in order to further validate his results. As early as March, he was able to save 100% of his patients. We all want a cure for the COVID-19 complications and mortality. Yadegar&#39;s cure is achieved through better testing and prevention and without ventilators! Dr. Yadegar can be reached at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in California."
"A much better approach to a cure was developed in March in California USA by Dr. Thomas Yadegar, ICU Director at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center and demonstrated a 100% CURE RATE of his COVID-19 patients. He developed a panel of tests  to PREDETERMINE which patients would develop chronic complications and he intervened by aggressively treating this small subset of patients  with anti-inflammatories and immunosuppressants to ameliorate their symptoms and PREVENTED them from having to go on ventilators. Isn&#39;t it better to prevent patients from going on ventilators rather than treating them once they are on ventilators? Of course it is. Due to his success with COVID-19, Dr. Yadegar is currently supervising treatments at 6 hospitals."
excellent information with all round coverage of new medicine.
"Did you cut your hair by yourself?  Not good at all. Dexamethasone 1/3rd and 1/5 are they good odds really, how is that much different from HCQ results?"
It&#39;s important to highlight thet please don&#39;t get excited because the side effects are hell severe.
Great

"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23purescience"">#PureScience</a> videos are getting much more views than other Print videos..<br>By looking at the comments..I am guessing the reason..😅😂"
Love this<br>Thanks
Situation sounds grim with number of experimental drugs being tried until a vaccine is out. Irreversible damage due to chinese negligence everyone is paying price of
media too hurry to make episode about what western countries found but took very long time when ICMR published study about Hydroxychloroquine as preventing measures.
We further need a breake through from medicinal experts and viroligists  the medicines or steroids which immediate prevent the further onset of infections after initial dosages .As like medicines must be given to patients at the very first stages to prevent further development of chain reaction.
its a scary drug with addictive side effects. i have administered dexa on trekkers on high altitude treks in the himalayas. the scarier part is that it is available easily in india at the chemists shop.
MY submission is that despite good  results of dexamethasone <br>It is given at two stages either patients on ventilators or with low oxygen .This again a stage that doctors must have excellent judgement skill the time of medicines given or injected. <br>Secondly even researchers has briefed one out eight patients likely to be recovered ie 20 %.<br>This steroids is good but require lotof skill of hospitals and doctors for the timing of dosages ie slip at this time may reduce the effect of medicines. Anyhow yet  research to be submitted and government a acceptability and WHO/ICMR approval needed.
She is beautiful 😍
Listen at 1.25 speed. Thank me later.

She has mostashes.
Sandhya please please please give an introduction of yourself like tiffiny mayer please ... And then continue.. You will be famous sure
Water the plants please
Dont spread false hopes. Dexamethasone is still not fully successful. It has similar success rate as India showed with hydroxychloroquine
why is the contribution link not in the description?
Again a concise and informative report on an important subject. <br>Well done guys👍
The body is very complex and works very well to preserve itself. The relationships between different chemicals are complex. It would be prudent to refrain from  discussing these technical aspects as many drugs are double edged sword. Especially in a drug as commonly available drug like dexamethazone which can lead to self administration
Your haircut is amazing 😍

"Perhaps this steroid can be administered to our failing and intellectually morbid Modi Tughlaq! Who knows, this might help turn his flaccid leadership into something more serviceable and help us maintain secure borders for once!"
all kind of steroids such as Dexametasone  tab &amp; inj // Prednislone  tab &amp; inj  // Bethamethasone tablet &amp; injection// Methyl Prednisolone etc   hopefully workout against covid.
Remdesivir also serves the same purpose right.  It increases recovery by 33%. So whats special about this.
TED ED just made a video on the same
Nice to see you again Sandhya with another great video ;)
